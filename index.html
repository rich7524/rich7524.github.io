        <p class = "about">Now, let's learn a little bit more about me!<br> My name is Hayden Richards and I am a Junior at the University of St. Thomas.<br>
            Major: <i>Computer Science</i><br>Minors: <i>Teacher Education</i> and <i>Applied Statistics</i></p>
        <p class = "mainPar">I decided on a switch from business to Computer Science
            last fall, and it was a great call! While challenging, I have grown to love the problem-solving aspect of coding, as well as the wide variety of directions
            you can go in the field. Education has always been a thought as well, so I decided to add the minor in the event I want to come back to school and be a teacher some day.
            <br><br><b>Goals</b>: One of my main goals is simply graduating college. I want to graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, and I'm over halfway there!
            I also have plenty of long-term goals, such as buying a house and having a family. Another thing I'd love to do someday is release a video game on Steam. A few friends
            and I began talking about trying to work on video games a little while back, and we have begun the process of learning more about it. I think that would be a really cool thing for
            my friends and I to be able to accomplish.</p>
